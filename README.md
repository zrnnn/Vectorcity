# VectorCity: Map-to-Laser SVG Generator 🚀

**Create stunning, customizable vector maps for your laser cutter, 3D printer, or print projects – all from a single HTML file!**

## ✨ Overview

VectorCity is a lightweight, browser-based tool that leverages OpenStreetMap's Overpass API to generate beautiful, high-detail city maps. Designed with makers in mind, it allows you to easily select an area, customize map features, and export it into versatile formats perfect for physical creation.

## 🌟 Features

* **Local & Lightweight:** Runs entirely in your web browser from a single `VectorCity.html` file. No server, no installation, just download and open!
* **Laser-Ready SVG Export:** Generate perfectly scalable vector graphics (.svg) optimized for laser cutting, engraving, and CNC machining. Includes intelligent line width scaling.
* **High-Resolution Print PNG Export:** Export crisp .png images at 600 DPI, ideal for art prints, posters, or digital use.
* **Customizable Map Layers:** Toggle and style individual map features like buildings, roads, waterways, and parks. Adjust colors and line thicknesses to create your desired aesthetic, perfect for high-contrast laser projects.
* **Precise Framing:** Define your exact map area and choose from common aspect ratios (A4, 1:1, 16:9, etc.) for perfect composition.
* **Metric Output Control:** Set your desired final output width in millimeters for direct compatibility with your physical projects.
